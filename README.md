# Movies API

The Movies API is a RESTful API designed to manage movie data. It uses IBM Cloud Object Storage to store images and MongoDB to store other movie-related data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Movies API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Gabicolombo/movies-api.git

    npm install
    ```

3. Run the API locally:

    ```

    ```

## Jenkins Integration

We have integrated Jenkins to track commits pushed to the main branch. This integration provides alerts and helps visualize the commit history. Below is a screenshot showing the commit history in Jenkins:
